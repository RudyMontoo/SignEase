# SignEase Technical Q&A Preparation\n## Comprehensive Question & Answer Guide\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Core Technical Questions\n\n### Model & AI Architecture\n\n**Q: What machine learning architecture do you use?**\n**A**: \"We use a multi-modal architecture combining EfficientNet-B4 for image feature extraction with MediaPipe hand landmarks for geometric features. This hybrid approach gives us both visual understanding and precise spatial relationships, achieving 99.57% accuracy.\"\n\n**Q: How did you achieve 99.57% accuracy?**\n**A**: \"Several key factors: First, our multi-modal approach combining visual and geometric features. Second, extensive data augmentation on 87,000 ASL images. Third, transfer learning from EfficientNet-B4 pre-trained on ImageNet. Fourth, advanced preprocessing with MediaPipe normalization. Finally, careful hyperparameter tuning and mixed precision training.\"\n\n**Q: What's your model size and inference time?**\n**A**: \"Our model has 32.4 million parameters. Core inference takes just 5.3ms on average, with end-to-end latency under 100ms including preprocessing and postprocessing. This is achieved through model optimization and GPU acceleration.\"\n\n**Q: How do you handle different hand sizes and positions?**\n**A**: \"MediaPipe provides normalized hand landmarks relative to the wrist and hand bounding box, making our system invariant to hand size and position. Our training data includes diverse hand sizes, ages, and skin tones for robust generalization.\"\n\n### Performance & Scalability\n\n**Q: What are your hardware requirements?**\n**A**: \"Minimum: Any device with a camera and modern browser. Optimal: GPU acceleration available. Memory usage is under 512MB. We support both WebGL and WASM backends with automatic fallback for maximum compatibility.\"\n\n**Q: How many concurrent users can you support?**\n**A**: \"Our current backend can handle 1000+ concurrent users.
